<description>Ever wanted to easily find a certain item after a trade on the map or where one of your named animals are? Then this mod is for you!

Default keybinding for opening the search window is 'Z'. Can be rebound.

Search for:
*Pawns by name or kind.
*Pawns belonging to colony.
*Things by their name.
*Across multiplie maps.
*With one click you can go to your pawn, thing or location!

Changes:
- Updated to work with B18
- Removed search world option. It didn't work anyway.
- Changed default search term to ".-"
- Made Search window draggable
- Now search window doesn't close when clicking go to item
- When rimsearch window opens the text box gets focus. Thanks Jamestec.
